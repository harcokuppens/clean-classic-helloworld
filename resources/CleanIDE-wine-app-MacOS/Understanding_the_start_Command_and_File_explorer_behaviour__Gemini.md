# Understanding the start Command and File Explorer Behaviors - Gemini

## Question 1

the following two start commands on windows behave different, the first opens in new
instance, whereaas the second in the current instance of the CleanIDE.exe
application: start CleanIDE.exe "Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"  start  ""
"Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"  and when I click on the .icl file in explorer
then it opens in the current instance, if I drag and drop the .icl file on
CleanIDE.exe in explorer it opens in a new instance explain

## Answer 1

Let's break down why these `start` commands and drag-and-drop behaviors differ with
`CleanIDE.exe` on Windows.

### Understanding the `start` Command

The `start` command in Windows is a shell command used to run programs or open
documents. Its behavior can be nuanced, especially regarding how it interprets its
arguments.

**1. `start CleanIDE.exe "Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"`**

- **`CleanIDE.exe`:** When you explicitly specify the executable (`CleanIDE.exe`) as
  the first argument to `start`, you're telling the `start` command _exactly_ what
  program to launch.
- **`"Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"`:** This path is then passed as an argument
  _to_ `CleanIDE.exe`.
- **Behavior: New Instance.** In this scenario, `start`'s primary job is to launch
  `CleanIDE.exe`. By default, when a program is launched directly via its executable
  name (or path), Windows tends to create a new process for it, which means a new
  instance of the application. The application itself (CleanIDE) then receives the
  file path as an argument and opens it within that newly launched instance.

**2. `start "" "Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"`**

- **`""` (Empty String):** This is the crucial part. When `start` encounters an empty
  string as its _first_ argument (after the `start` command itself, but before the
  file/program to open), it interprets the _next_ argument as the title for a new
  command prompt window (if it were opening a command prompt) or, more relevant here,
  it signals to `start` that it should operate in a "document-centric" mode.
- **`"Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"`:** This is the file you want to open.
- **Behavior: Current Instance (or Associated Application).** When `start` is used
  with an empty string as the first argument, followed by a document, it attempts to
  open that document using its **default associated application**. This is the same
  mechanism that happens when you double-click a file in File Explorer.
  - Windows looks up the file extension (`.icl` in this case) in the Registry to find
    which program is registered to handle it.
  - If `CleanIDE.exe` is registered as the default handler for `.icl` files, Windows
    will then attempt to tell the _already running_ instance of `CleanIDE.exe` to
    open the file. Most well-behaved applications, when told to open a file via their
    association, will try to open it within an existing instance if one is running,
    rather than launching a new one. This is to provide a smoother user experience
    and conserve resources.

### File Explorer Behaviors

**1. Clicking on the `.icl` file in Explorer:**

- **Behavior: Current Instance.** This is the classic "file association" mechanism.
  When you double-click a file, Windows uses the same logic as `start ""` with a
  document. It queries the Registry for the default application associated with that
  file type (`.icl`). If `CleanIDE.exe` is the registered handler and a
  `CleanIDE.exe` instance is already running, Windows will send a message (often via
  DDE - Dynamic Data Exchange, or more modern mechanisms like COM/RPC) to the
  existing instance, telling it to open the specified file.

**2. Drag and Drop the `.icl` file on `CleanIDE.exe` in Explorer:**

- **Behavior: New Instance.** When you drag a file onto an executable in File
  Explorer, you are essentially telling Windows to "launch this executable _and_ pass
  this dragged file as an argument to it." This is analogous to the first `start`
  command: `CleanIDE.exe "Examples\Small Examples\acker.icl"`.
  - Windows doesn't go through the file association lookup in this case. It directly
    launches the executable you dropped the file onto.
  - Since it's a direct launch of the executable with an argument, it typically
    results in a new process/instance of `CleanIDE.exe`, which then opens the file.

### Summary of Differences:

- **`start CleanIDE.exe ...` and Drag-and-Drop:** These methods explicitly launch
  `CleanIDE.exe` and pass the file as an argument. By default, this creates a new
  process/instance.
- **`start "" ...` and Double-Clicking in Explorer:** These methods rely on Windows'
  file association mechanism. They tell Windows to "open this document," and Windows
  then dispatches the request to the _registered handler_ for that file type.
  Well-behaved applications (like CleanIDE seems to be for `.icl` files) will often
  handle these requests by opening the file within an existing instance if one is
  available.

The key takeaway is how the command is interpreted by the shell (`start` command) or
the operating system (File Explorer) and whether it's treated as a direct program
launch or a request to open a document via its default handler.
